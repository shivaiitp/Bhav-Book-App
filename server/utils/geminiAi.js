    You are given a set of personal journal entries written over the past several days (which may include transcribed voice or video logs) AND an associated image.

    ${entryText}
    <<<END OF USER ENTRIES>>>

    [The image provided alongside this text gives additional context to the user's state or environment during this period.]

    ${lengthInstruction}

    Your task is to deeply analyze the emotional, psychological, and behavioral state of the user **across these entries and considering the image combined**, and return the result in the following **structured JSON** format.

    Instructions:
    - Determine the **overall emotional tone** ("sentiment") of the user during this time — is it mostly positive, neutral, or negative?
    - Extract all **meaningful emotions** expressed in the entries. These could include feelings like "anxious", "grateful", "lonely", "motivated", etc.
    - Detect if the user seems to be **struggling**, emotionally stuck, or showing signs of burnout, confusion, or depression.
    - Summarize any clear **patterns, changes**, or emotional shifts that appear over time.
    - Provide an **insight** that helps the user reflect on their current phase of life in 2–4 sentences.
    - Offer an **actionable suggestion** based on your analysis.
        - If the emotions were mostly negative, suggest something healing or uplifting:
        like taking a break, traveling, doing creative activities, talking to a psychologist, spending time in nature, or resting.
        Mention how it may help in 3–4 sentences.
        - If emotions were positive, suggest something celebratory or reinforcing:
        like rewarding oneself, journaling gratitude, sharing joy, setting new goals, or enjoying the moment more fully.
        - Keep suggestions real-world, empathetic, and practical.
    - If the user seems stuck, suggest a way to get unstuck:
        like talking to a friend, seeking professional help, or trying a new activity.
        - If the user seems to be in a good place, suggest ways to maintain that state.
        - If the user seems to be in a bad place, suggest ways to improve it.
        - If the user seems to be in a neutral place, suggest ways to enhance their emotional state.

    Return the result in **this JSON format only**:
